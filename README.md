## JavaScript Introduction:

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## JavaScript Features:

1. **Interpreted Language:** JavaScript is an interpreted language, not compiled.
2. **Client-Side Language:** JavaScript is a client-side language. It runs on the client-side browser.
3. **Object-Based:** JavaScript is an object-based language.
4. **Lightweight:** JavaScript is lightweight.
5. **Versatile:** JavaScript is versatile.
6. **High Performance:** JavaScript is a high-performance language.
7. **Interpreted Language:** JavaScript is an interpreted language, not compiled.
8. **Client-Side Language:** JavaScript is a client-side language. It runs on the client-side browser.
9. **Object-Based:** JavaScript is an object-based language.
10. **Lightweight:** JavaScript is lightweight.
11. **Versatile:** JavaScript is versatile.
12. **High Performance:** JavaScript is a high-performance language.

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## JavaScript Advantages:

1. **Less Server Interaction:** You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
2. **Immediate Feedback to the Visitors:** They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
3. **Increased Interactivity:** You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
4. **Richer Interfaces:** You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
5. **Server Load:** You can reduce the server load by using JavaScript to validate form data before sending it to the server. This way, your server doesn't have to do as much work.

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## JavaScript Limitations:

1. **Client-Side Security:** You should be aware that JavaScript is executed on the client-side. So, it doesn't have the ability to interact with the database.
2. **Browser Support:** You have to write different code for different browsers. For example, Chrome, Firefox, and IE.
3. **No Multithreading or Multiprocessing:** JavaScript does not provide the facility for multithreading or multiprocessing.

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## JavaScript Syntax:

1. **Case Sensitivity:** JavaScript is case-sensitive.
2. **Semicolons:** JavaScript uses semicolons to separate statements.
3. **Whitespace:** JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
4. **Comments:** JavaScript supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## JavaScript Variables:

1. **Variable:** A variable is a container for storing data values.
2. **Variable Naming:** A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
3. **Variable Scope:** The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes: global and local.
4. **Variable Declaration:** You can declare a variable in JavaScript using the var keyword.
5. **Variable Initialization:** You can initialize a variable in JavaScript when you declare it.
6. **Variable Re-declaration:** You can re-declare a JavaScript variable without generating an error.
7. **Variable Hoisting:** JavaScript hoists variable declarations to the top of the current scope.



&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## Including JavaScript in an HTML-Page:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  // JS code gose here
</script>
```

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## Call an External JavaScript file:

```
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## Comments:

Single line comments : ``` // only single line comments ```

Multi-line comments : ``` /* comment here */ ```

&uarr; [back to Top](#top)
## Variables in JavaScript:

``` var : common variable, scoped to functions. ```

``` const : Immutable variable. ```
